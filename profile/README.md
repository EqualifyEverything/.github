## Equalify the web!
**96.8% of home pages have WCAG conformance failures.[^1]** Failing WCAG conformance means countless people with disabilities do not have equal access to the internet.

We aim to make websites more accessible by building an affordable and easy-to-use platform that integrates your favorite accessibility web services. The core of our work is published under the AGPL on the [Core Equalify repo](http://github.com/EqualifyWverything/equalify). Working in the open helps us create the most accessible platform for internet accessibility.
