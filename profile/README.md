## Equalify the web!
96.8% of home pages have WCAG conformance failures.1 Failing WCAG conformance means countless people with disabilities do not have equal access to the internet.

Equalify aims to make websites more accessible. We are building an affordable and easy-to-use platform that integrates your favorite accessibility web services. The core of our work is published under the AGPL at http://github.com/bbertucc/equalify. Working in the open helps us create the most accessible platform for internet accessibility.
